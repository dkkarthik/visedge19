            <h5>WELCOME TO VisEdge 2019!</h5>

            <p class="lead">
                The VisEdge '19' workshop is scheduled on November 9, 2019 and will be held at Washington, D.C., USA.
            </p>

            <p> This year VisEdge will be co-located with
                <a href="http://acm-ieee-sec.org/2019/"> the Fourth ACM/IEEE Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC 2019)</a>.</p>

<!--            <p> HotWeb is a forum that brings together researchers and
                practitioners interested in the design, implementation, and
                evaluation of Internet systems and applications. Sponsored by the ACM,
                the IEEE Computer Society,  and by IEEE-CS Technical Committee on
                the Internet, the workshop seeks to act as a conduit for the
                presentation of novel approaches used in support of performance,
                scalability, and security of Internet systems and applications, including
                Web searching and indexing, content distribution and delivery
                networks, Web services, online social networks, Web of Things,
                mobile Web, and edge computing.</p>

                <p>The topics of interest include, but are by no means limited
                to:</p>

                <ul>

                <p> Edge computing is the idea of moving the computing
                  from the cloud closer to the sensing. There has also been a
                  dramatic increase in cameras on mobile devices. This allows
                  us to envision a several mobile vision applications such as
                  object detection, activity recognition, localization, mapping,
                  human-computer interaction and others. Cameras produce data
                  and high rates and require heavy computational resources to
                  enable these applications. Utilizing computing at the edge
                  will be very advantageous for such applications. Benefits
                  include increasing compute power, efficient use of battery, preserving the locality of
                  computing and privacy of data. VisEdge '19 is a workshop that aims to bring together researchers
                  and practitioners from academia and industry working
                  on visual sensing in mobile systems with particular focus on the
                  use of Edge Computing architectures to improve visual sensing in
                  such systems. </p>

                  <p>Particular topics of interest include: </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li> Novel computer vision applications at the Edge </li>
                    <li> Adaptation of well-known computer vision algorithms to
                      the Edge computing paradigm </li>
