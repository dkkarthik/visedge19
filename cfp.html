            <p>Papers describing timely research contributions in VisEdge's areas of interest are solicited. Papers reporting
                on initial results as well as papers discussing mature research projects or case studies of deployed systems
                are sought out. Submissions describing big ideas that may have significant impact and could lead to interesting
                discussions at the workshop are encouraged. </p>

            <p>Submitted papers must be neither previously published nor under review by another workshop, conference or journal.
                Only electronic submissions in PDF will be accepted. Submitted papers must be written in English, must be
